<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Samy</h1>
<h3 align="center">A girl with a passion for the creativity and the technology</h3>
<p> I have always had a strong passion for programming and everything related to it, which is why I have decided to deepen my knowledge more and more. Despite being a game developer with a couple of years of experience with Unreal Engine, I now wanted to take an important new step for my profession, which is to study Godot Engine.

I mainly use C++ and Blueprint, Python and Godot script as programming languages, however, following other branches of the sector, I have chosen to focus my study on front-end knowledge with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React.js framework, while for the back-end Node.js with notions of MongoDB.

Although I know that this path has no end, I am motivated to continue constantly every day.

üî≠ I‚Äôm working as Front-End Developer<br> üìö I'm currently learning <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">

üë®‚Äçüíª All of my projects: <br/>
<strong>JavaScript: <br/></strong>
[Counter](https://github.com/SamantaMancini/Counter)  <br/> For this project, I used vanilla JavaScript. It's a simple counter with three buttons, each with a constant variable document.createElement('button'). I added id elements to these three buttons using setAttribute('id', 'buttons') and linked them to the div of the HTML5 page with the appendChild() function. For the text, I used the button variable name + innerText. For the click event, I used the addEventListener('click', function(event) {}) inside the function there is a constant that takes event.target.id and a condition that if the button is equal to its id and is not disabled, the value increases and the button sound is heard with audio.play(), and if it is reset, the count variable becomes zero and all buttons are disabled. And I called the timed function called setInterval(changeColor, 500) to do the flash effect that changes color to red and returns to normal and the stopTimeout() function that stops after 5 seconds. In the second JS sheet, I made a JS array with five images from the Hobbit movie and an infinite loop. As a bonus, I preferred to work on the responsive part with the function called Mediaquery and I used window.matchMedia("(max-width: 1280px)").
